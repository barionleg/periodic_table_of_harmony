Periodic Table of Harmony is an interactive undirected unweighted network diagram of all unique circular permutaion set partitions of 12. It represents all harmony possible in 12-TET, grouped in families based on whether the harmonic structures invert to eachother. I refer to each family as harmony sets (how I usually describe the data in the dataset), rings (visual description) or nodes (graph terminology). Each node is drawn using d3's pie chart tools.
